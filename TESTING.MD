# Validation Testing

## [HTML Validation](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)

Using my deployed Heroku App, I ran each url of the website through the HTML validator and corrected the following:

- &copy copyright change to &169
- orphan element tags were closed off

## [CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

CSS was directly input to the CSS Validator from each static folder in the app and no errors were found.

## [JS Hint](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

JS Hint was used to validate javascript code and the following errors were corrected:

- missing semi-colons were added

## [Python Validator](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)

Pep8 CI was used to validate python code and the following errors were corrected:

- lines too long
- need new lines at end of file
- blank lines contains whitespace

## [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/)

Lighthouse was run to check the quality of the app. Overall the scores were high. 
Performance was quite low due to First Contentful Paint. I implemented some of hte suggestions.
However, there is no noticeable delay in page loading time.
