# Validation Testing

## [HTML Validation](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)

Using my deployed Heroku App, I ran each url of the website through the HTML validator and corrected the following:

- &copy copyright change to &169
- orphan element tags were closed off

## [CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

CSS was directly input to the CSS Validator from each static folder in the app and no errors were found.

## [JS Hint](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

JS Hint was used to validate javascript code and the following errors were corrected:

- missing semi-colons were added
